# python-password-gen
A simple password generator that I made in python

What does it include? Let me tell you:

- Allows you to generate a password anywhere from 1-16 characters!

- Has a strength checker

- Allows you to save to desktop into a .txt file is the password is strong enough!


How do you compile it into a .exe?

`pip install pyinstaller`

There. Now, CD into the directory that you have saved the file. EG: `cd C:\Users\YOURUSER\Desktop`

Now, write: `pyinstaller --onefile password.generator.py`

Boom!
